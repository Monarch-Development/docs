## How to set/get fuel?
First you need to retrieve the vehicle entity handle (with ox_lib `cache.vehicle`)

```lua title="Retrieve Vehicle Entity"
    local playerPed = PlayerPedId()
    local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(playerPed, false)
```

Then you need to set the statebag for get/set the fuel

```lua title="Statebag Setup"
    -- previous locals to get the vehicle entity
    Entity(vehicle).state.fuel
```

Now you can get or set the value of the Statebag in this ways

```lua title="Get Fuel Level"
    local playerPed = PlayerPedId()
    local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(playerPed, false)
    
    local fuel = Entity(vehicle).state.fuel
```

```lua title="Set Fuel Level"
    local playerPed = PlayerPedId()
    local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(playerPed, false)
    
    Entity(vehicle).state.fuel = 100
```

```lua title="Set Fuel Level (with server replication)"
    local playerPed = PlayerPedId()
    local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(playerPed, false)
    
    Entity(vehicle).state:set("fuel", 100, true)
```
