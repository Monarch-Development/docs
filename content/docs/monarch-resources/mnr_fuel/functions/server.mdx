## How to set/get fuel?
With Statebags is possible to get the fuel level value also from server with a different process, let's retrieve the vehicle server entity

```lua title="Retrieve Vehicle Entity"
    local vehicle = NetToVeh(netId)
```

Then you need to set the statebag for get/set the fuel

```lua title="Statebag Setup"
    -- previous locals to get the vehicle entity
    Entity(vehicle).state.fuel
```

Now you can get or set the value of the Statebag in this ways

```lua title="Get Fuel Level"
    local vehicle = NetToVeh(netId)

    local fuel = Entity(vehicle).state.fuel
```

```lua title="Set Fuel Level"
    local vehicle = NetToVeh(netId)
    
    Entity(vehicle).state.fuel = 100
```
