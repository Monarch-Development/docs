title: Monarch IPL
description: Optimized resource for IPL management of MLOs.
---

Monarch IPL is an optimized and simple script that uses a zones/points system for dynamic load IPLs of MLOs and manage them easily

### What are IPLs?
Explained in very simple words it is a way for maps to load some of their parts through a script to avoid players from rendering them unnecessarily thus saving performance. For example Cayo Perico Island is a collection of IPLs that form the island, however its distance and size makes it counterproductive to load using this method.
