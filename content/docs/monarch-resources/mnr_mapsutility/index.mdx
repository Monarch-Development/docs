## Fivem Curiosities

### Unique named blips [LIMIT]

<Callout title="PROBLEM" type="warn">
  FiveM has a limit for the map side menu, in fact the blips with unique name cannot exceed 99 slots, beyond that limit the blips will start to function badly (the menu will not be displayed correctly or the blips will not be selectable as expected)
</Callout>

<Callout title="SOLUTION" type="info">
  To avoid incurring the limit as well as not exceeding 99 blips with different names it is advisable to collect as many blips as possible under a single general name that will collect them all in a single name slot

  Example:
  - Paleto Store ---> Store
  - Sandy Store ---> Store
