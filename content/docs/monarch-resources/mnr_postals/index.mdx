Monarch Postals allows players to set a postal destination on the map with a simple command, this script isn't made from scratch but is a remake of [nearest-postal](https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal) by DevBlocky

## Innovations
- Removed 3dtext feature that showed nearby postal because it was resmon intensive
- Completely revamped the code to use the optimized ox_lib functions
- Reworked the data coordinates (.json table > .lua vec2) and reduced the digits of the numbers for each coordinate

## Compatible Postal Maps
- [New Atlas Postal Map](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-postal-code-map-minimap-new-improved-v1-3/147458)
- [OCRP Postal Map](https://forum.cfx.re/t/ocrp-postal-and-minimap-server-side/992775)
- [Oulsen Satmap](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-free-high-resolution-satellite-map-with-custom-postals/2503527)
